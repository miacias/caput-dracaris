# caput-draconis-password-generator
Password Generator (JavaScript)

## Description 

 Caput Draconis is a password generator designed to match to the User's desire of what is included and the length of characters that will be used. This project is named "Caput Draconis" after the Lady In The Painting from Harry Potter who holds the password to Gryffindoor Commons. The generator draws from four character types: special characters, numeric characters, upper-, and lowercase letters.  
 
 The motivation behind this project was to design an easy way for users to generate entirely randomized passwords in just a few clicks. Each character type is equitably represented from character types that the user selects to include in their customized password, ensuring that even though there are significantly more letters than numbers to choose from, each character type has an equal chance of appearing in the password. This password generator is designed to help Users no longer have to waste time inventing passwords on their own, and it also solves the problem and very real risk of using a predictable password. 
 
 In developing this random password generator, I learned how important it is to be explicit while coding so the program will respond with precision each time it is used. I also learned to be wary of potential ways that code can break - whether it be by incorrect inputs by the user or getting lost in recursion. One of the most important takeaways I have from approaching this project is that there is always more that can be done: streamlining code, adding features, and adding other inventive ideas.


## Installation 

 N/A. [Deployed site here!](link to live site)
 

## Usage 

 1. Click the "Generate Password" button on the screen.
 2. Follow the prompts in the pop-up windows to provide the generator information on what you want in your password and how long you want it to be.
    - "Ok" on a Character Question means you want to include something
    - "Cancel" on a Character Question means you do not want to include something
 3. A password will appear in the box for you to record in a safe location.
 4. It is possible to make multiple passwords with new criteria each time the "Generate Password" button is clicked and the prompts are completed. However, previous passwords will disappear.
